24. September 2003
------------------
General
 - Temporarily disabled file uploads (pending final fileapi).

 + Added a project.css to split style out of the code.
 + Added navigation trail to several pages.

Projects
 - Projects are now nodes, with all the benefits that brings: taxonomy,
   users can submit and maintain their own projects, etc.
 - Versions have been replaced with releases.

 + Added more data to projects (link to hp, demo, etc).
 + Added project uri: /project/<name>. Uses node->path
 + Added release directory option for projects that don't require file
   uploads.
 + Added taxonomy support to projects. Limited support in project
   navigation.
 + Create a better download page when release_directory is used.

Issues (bug reports, etc)
 - Updates to issues are no longer saved as node revisions.
 - Developers are no longer a fixed list. Instead users assigns issues
   to their account. Assigning bugs to others is no longer supported.
 - Tweaked the output for node view to make the original report stand
   out from the comments/updates.
 - Tweaked mails to highlight new changes more from previous changes.
 - Changed output for "view your projects".
 - Changed mailhandler to be completely custom instead of using the
   default handler and improve usability.
 - Fixed pager support so it remembers searches.
 - Improved search to let you select multiple values for fields.

 + Add possibility to link to a specific issue listing. Examples:
     List all open issues:       /project/issues?states=1,2
     List all open bug reports:  /project/drupal/issues?states=1,2&categories=bug
     List open project issues:   /project/drupal/issues?states=1,2
     List issues assigned to user: /project/drupal/issues?assigned=1
 + Added support request category.
 + Added file uploads to issues.
 + Added tablesort support for issue listings.
 + Monthly mail to remind users to follow up on their open issues.
 + Users can subscribe to get no mail, mails for issues they are
   involved with or all issues per project.

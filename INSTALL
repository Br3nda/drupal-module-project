Installation
------------

1. Place all the files in modules/project, include the CSS and include
   files.

2. Create the SQL tables. This depends your system and database 
   backend, but if using MySQL this should work:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < project.mysql
   If you don't have command line access you will have to load the
   project.mysql using the tools you do have access to.

3. Enable the project module under "site configuration".

4. Use the administration pages to setup proper access and projects.

Upgrading
---------

0. Make sure you backup your database!

1. Load the new SQL definitions.
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < project.mysql

2. Copy upgrade-project.php to the root directory of your Drupal site.

3. Point your browser to http://example.com/drupal/upgrade-project.php

4. Delete upgrade-project.php and the old project and projects table
   from SQL.

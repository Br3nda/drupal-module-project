Installation
------------

1. Copy the project/ directory to modules/

2. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the
   most common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < project.mysql

3. Enable the project module under "site configuration".

4. Use the administration pages to setup proper access and projects.

Upgrading
---------

0. Make sure you backup your database!

1. Load the new SQL definitions.
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < project.mysql

2. Copy upgrade-project.php to the root directory of your Drupal site.

3. Point your browser to http://example.com/drupal/upgrade-project.php

4. Delete upgrade-project.php and the old project and projects table
   from SQL.

   issues at once (mass closing).

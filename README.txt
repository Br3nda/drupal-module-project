This module enables teams to track outstanding items which need
resolution. It provides e-mail notifications to members about updates
to items. Similar to many issue tracking systems.

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project.

The project module is currently being maintained by:
Derek Wright <drupal-project@dwwright.net>

General
 - Improve themeability of listings and issues.
 - RSS feeds for projects, new releases, issues, etc.
 - Integration with the Organic Groups module.

 - Integrate image module galleries for screenshots.

Issues (bug reports, etc)
 - Using the existing Drupal "comment" system for issue replies
   instead of the customized issue "follow-ups" currently in place.
 - Better mailhandler integration for creating and replying to issues
   via email.

   request, etc).

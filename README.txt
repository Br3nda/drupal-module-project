This module provides a content type for Drupal sites, the "project"
node. Projects can have releases associated with them, and this module
provides various ways to search for projects and download specific
releases.

Project nodes can have issue tracking associated with them by enabling
the project_issue module (http://drupal.org/project/project_issue),
and can be integrated with a CVS repository by enabling the cvslog
module (http://drupal.org/project/cvslog).

Send feature requests and bug reports to the issue tracking system for
the project module: http://drupal.org/node/add/project_issue/project.

The project module is currently being maintained by:
Derek Wright <drupal-project@dwwright.net>

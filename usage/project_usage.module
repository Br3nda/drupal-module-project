 * This module provides logging of the requests sent by the
 * update_status.module (contrib in 5.x) and update.module (core in 6.x) to the
 * project_release.module on updates.drupal.org. The
 * release/project-release-serve-history.php script inserts data into the
 * {project_usage_raw} table created by this module.
 *
 * On a daily basis the usage data is matched to project and release nodes
 * and moved into the {project_usage_day} table. On a weekly basis the daily
 * usage data is tallied and stored in the {project_usage_week} table.
 *
 * This data is then used to compute live usage statistics about all projects
 * hosted on drupal.org. In theory, another site could setup
 * update_status.module-style checking to their own project.module-based
 * server, in which case, they might want to enable this module. Otherwise,
 * sites should just leave this disabled.
